<h1>Beyonce Upgrade you</h1>   
<p>Hehehe, yeah B Talk yo' shit heheh (partner let me upgrade you)<br>
 How you gon' upgrade me<br>
What's higher than number one <br>
You know I used to beat that block<br>
Now I be's the block (partner let me upgrade you)<br>
[Verse 1: Beyonce] <br>
I hear you be the block <br>
But I'm the lights that keep the streets on<br>
Notice you the type that like to keep them on a<br>
Leash though<br>
I'm known to walk alone<br>
But I'm alone for a reason<br>
Sending me a drink ain't appeasing<br>
Believe me Come harder this wont be easy<br>
Don't doubt yourself trust me you need me<br>
This ain't a shoulder with a chip or an ego<br>
 But what you think they all mad at me for
